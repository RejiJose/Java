Problem 1:
Modify the Student class to store and add courses as an array of strings. 
  - You will need to add a class variable and change the constructor for the Student class.

Problem 2:
Write a function checkCourse() in the Student class that accepts a course (as a string) and returns true if the student is taking that course; otherwise return false.

Problem 3:
Create two student objects in the Main file > init fn. Use the arrays courses1 and courses2 when creating the two student objects.

Problem 4:
Produce an output to indicate if each student's course-load includes a specific course.
