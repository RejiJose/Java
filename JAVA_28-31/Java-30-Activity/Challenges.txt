Challenge 1:

Challenge 2:
Create two car objects and store them in separate variables.

Challenge 3:
Display to the console the brand, model and value of each car.
Make the ist car honk.

Bonus:
Display the brand and model of any car that has a value over 30,000. (You need to get that information from the object itself to determine the value.)
