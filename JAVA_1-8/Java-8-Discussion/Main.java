    /*    Functions (called Methods in Java)
      1) A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

      2) You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

      3) Functions are used to perform certain actions

      4) Functions can return data.

      5) Why use functions? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

      Summary:      
      Functions usually "take in" data, "process" it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over again.
