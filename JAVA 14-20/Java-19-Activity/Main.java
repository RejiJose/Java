  Challenge 3:
  Write a function diceDistribution() that accepts an integer N and rolls a die N times, keeps a counter of the number of times 1,2,3,4,5,6 was rolled (need a counter for each) and displays the counters for each.
  Test with N values of 100, 1000, 100000, and 1000000.  What do the results look like as the number N gets larger?

  Challenge 5:
  Write a function mathQuiz() that generates a random addition, subtraction, multiplication or division problem of two random integers, prompts the user for the answer. It returns "Correct!" if the answer is correct, otherwise returns "Incorrect". The random integers should range from -20 to 20 (inclusively).
  Hint: For the random operations (+,-,*,/) using a random number from 0 to 3 where 0 means +, 1 means -, 2 means * and 3 means /.
